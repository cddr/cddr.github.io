My name is Andy Chambers. I'm a software engineer with interests in getting
data from A to B. Recently I've been having a lot of fun doing that with
with Clojure and Kafka. In the past, I've had fun doing it with Ruby, Java
and XSLT.

### More Information

Besides writing software, I like [riding my bike](https://www.stirlingbikeclub.org.uk/)
and [running up hills](http://www.ochilhillrunners.org.uk/home.aspx).

So that you can quickly know whether to ignore me or not, my position on a few of the
divisive issues in software is...

 * tabs vs spaces? (meh who cares)
 * vi vs emacs? (emacs obviously)
 * dynamic vs static types (dynamic but open to pairing sessions that would prove otherwise)
